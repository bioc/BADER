Description: For RNA sequencing count data, BADER fits a Bayesian
        hierarchical model. The algorithm returns the posterior
        probability of differential expression for each gene between
        two groups A and B. The joint posterior distribution of the
        variables in the model can be returned in the form of posterior
        samples, which can be used for further down-stream analyses
        such as gene set enrichment.
